## DeepL Translator

This simple React app will translate given text to any language in the DeepL Translate library.

### Starting the app

In the interest of security, I have not included an API Key in this version. In order to translate text, change the return value in apikey.js to your own "DeepL API Free" key.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
